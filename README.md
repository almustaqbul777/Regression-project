 
# **Regression Project: EDA & Two Regression Models**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of two regression models to predict target values with high accuracy. Through comprehensive data analysis and model optimization, the project achieved an impressive accuracy of over 98%.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Extensive EDA:** Identified key patterns, trends, and outliers to better understand the dataset.  
- **Two Regression Models:** Implemented and compared the performance of two different regression algorithms.  
- **High Accuracy:** Both models were fine-tuned to achieve an accuracy exceeding 98%.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  
[Retail Store Inventory Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anirudhchauhan/retail-store-inventory-forecasting-dataset)  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Regression Algorithms (Specify the models, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)  

## **Results**  
- Model 1 Accuracy: 98%  
- Model 2 Accuracy: 98%
